The tidy file generated by the script has the following structure:

##Structure

The following are the columns contained in the tidy file.

###Activity

Activity being done while the data was measured:

* WALKING
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* SITTING
* STANDING
* LAYING

###Subject

Id of the subject who was executing the activity

###tBodyAcc_mean_X, tBodyAcc_mean_Y, tBodyAcc_mean_Z

The mean of all the samples in that activity/subject group for the Body acceleration signal mean  (Axis x,y,z)

###tBodyAcc_std_X, tBodyAcc_std_Y, tBodyAcc_std_Z

The mean of all the samples in that activity/subject group for the Body acceleration signal standard deviation  (Axis x,y,z)

###tGravityAcc_mean_X, tGravityAcc_mean_Y, tGravityAcc_mean_Z

The mean of all the samples in that activity/subject group for the gravity acceleration signal mean (Axis x,y,z)

###tGravityAcc_std_X, tGravityAcc_std_Y, tGravityAcc_std_Z

The mean of all the samples in that activity/subject group for the gravity acceleration signal standard deviation (Axis x,y,z)

##Transformation

The names of the measurement columns where taking from the datasets (features.txt) but the '_' character was used to replace '-' and ')' and '(' . 

The mean function was also used to consolidate all the measurements within the same Activity/Subject group.
